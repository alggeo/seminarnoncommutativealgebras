# Seminar on the Groebnerbasistheory of artin algebras

## Main results

The goal was to understand the theory of groebner basis for finitely generated artin algebras for the purpose of implementation in computer programms.
As an extension, the minimal projective resolutions of such algebras as bimodules over itself were studied to be able to compute further invariants.
These goals have been accomplished.

As a byproduct, the exercises turned out to have been left to the reader in generous amounts in the paper of Bardzell, were filled in.
Moreover, an improvement in the techniques used in this paper has been suggested: 
the paper uses a very artifical order of the caconical basis of certain projective bimodules, which is replaced with an order that is more general and natural.
The validity of the arguments that relied on this order seem to be all still valid using the suggested alterantive.
